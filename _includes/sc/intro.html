  workshops, in general, aim to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This workshop is an extension of a Softare Carpentry Workshop
  and aims to teach researchers how to use Docker and the importance
  of reproducible research.
  This workshop will briefly review the importance of reproduciblility,
  and then move the the hands-on portion, learning to make containers in Docker.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

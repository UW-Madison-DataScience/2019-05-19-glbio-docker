  Approximate schedule can be found on the docker lesson webpage [linked here](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/docker-introduction/).
  There will be a break at about 2:30pm and instead of the last two lessons (cloud and containers from this lesson) we will have some free working time at the end.
